# # How to manage conversation history
# 
# One of the most common use cases for persistence is to use it to keep track of conversation history. This is great - it makes it easy to continue conversations. As conversations get longer and longer, however, this conversation history can build up and take up more and more of the context window. This can often be undesirable as it leads to more expensive and longer calls to the LLM, and potentially ones that error. In order to prevent this from happening, you need to probably manage the conversation history.
# 
# Note: this guide focuses on how to do this in LangGraph, where you can fully customize how this is done. If you want a more off-the-shelf solution, you can look into functionality provided in LangChain:

# - [How to trim messages](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/how_to/trim_messages/)

# ## Setup
# 
# First, let's set up the packages we're going to want to use



get_ipython().run_cell_magic('capture', '--no-stderr', '%pip install --quiet -U langgraph langchain_anthropic\n')


# Next, we need to set API keys for Anthropic (the LLM we will use)



import getpass
import os


def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")


_set_env("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")


# Optionally, we can set API key for [LangSmith tracing](https://smith.langchain.com/), which will give us best-in-class observability.



os.environ["LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2"] = "true"
_set_env("LANGCHAIN_API_KEY")


# ## Build the agent
# Let's now build a simple ReAct style agent.

# ## Filtering messages
# 
# The most straight-forward thing to do to prevent conversation history from blowing up is to filter the list of messages before they get passed to the LLM. This involves two parts: defining a function to filter messages, and then adding it to the graph. See the example below which defines a really simple `filter_messages` function and then uses it.
