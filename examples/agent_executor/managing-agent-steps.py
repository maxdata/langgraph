# # Managing Agent Steps
# 
# In this notebook we will go over how to build a basic agent executor where we custom handle how to manage the intermediate steps. Normally, all previous steps are passed to the agent at future iterations, but in long-running cases that could lead to an overly large amount of steps that you may want to trim
# 
# This examples builds off the base agent executor. It is highly recommended you learn about that executor before going through this notebook. You can find documentation for that example [here](./base.ipynb).
# 
# Any modifications of that example are called below with **MODIFICATION**, so if you are looking for the differences you can just search for that.

# ## Setup
# 
# First we need to install the packages required



get_ipython().run_cell_magic('capture', '--no-stderr', '%pip install --quiet -U langgraph langchain langchain_openai tavily-python\n')


# Next, we need to set API keys for OpenAI (the LLM we will use) and Tavily (the search tool we will use)



import getpass
import os

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("OpenAI API Key:")
os.environ["TAVILY_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("Tavily API Key:")


# Optionally, we can set API key for [LangSmith tracing](https://smith.langchain.com/), which will give us best-in-class observability.



os.environ["LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2"] = "true"
os.environ["LANGCHAIN_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("LangSmith API Key:")


# ## Create the LangChain agent
# 
# First, we will create the LangChain agent. For more information on LangChain agents, see [this documentation](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/concepts/#agents)



from langchain import hub
from langchain.agents import create_openai_functions_agent
from langchain_community.tools.tavily_search import TavilySearchResults
from langchain_openai.chat_models import ChatOpenAI

tools = [TavilySearchResults(max_results=1)]

# Get the prompt to use - you can modify this!
prompt = hub.pull("hwchase17/openai-functions-agent")

# Choose the LLM that will drive the agent
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo-1106", streaming=True)

# Construct the OpenAI Functions agent
agent_runnable = create_openai_functions_agent(llm, tools, prompt)


# ## Define the graph state
# 
# We now define the graph state. The state for the traditional LangChain agent has a few attributes:
# 
# 1. `input`: This is the input string representing the main ask from the user, passed in as input.
# 2. `chat_history`: This is any previous conversation messages, also passed in as input.
# 3. `intermediate_steps`: This is list of actions and corresponding observations that the agent takes over time. This is updated each iteration of the agent.
# 4. `agent_outcome`: This is the response from the agent, either an AgentAction or AgentFinish. The AgentExecutor should finish when this is an AgentFinish, otherwise it should call the requested tools.
# 



import operator
from typing import Annotated, TypedDict, Union

from langchain_core.agents import AgentAction, AgentFinish
from langchain_core.messages import BaseMessage


class AgentState(TypedDict):
    # The input string
    input: str
    # The list of previous messages in the conversation
    chat_history: list[BaseMessage]
    # The outcome of a given call to the agent
    # Needs `None` as a valid type, since this is what this will start as
    agent_outcome: Union[AgentAction, AgentFinish, None]
    # List of actions and corresponding observations
    # Here we annotate this with `operator.add` to indicate that operations to
    # this state should be ADDED to the existing values (not overwrite it)
    intermediate_steps: Annotated[list[tuple[AgentAction, str]], operator.add]


# ## Define the nodes
# 
# We now need to define a few different nodes in our graph.
# In `langgraph`, a node can be either a function or a [runnable](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/concepts/#langchain-expression-language-lcel).
# There are two main nodes we need for this:
# 
# 1. The agent: responsible for deciding what (if any) actions to take.
# 2. A function to invoke tools: if the agent decides to take an action, this node will then execute that action.
# 
# We will also need to define some edges.
# Some of these edges may be conditional.
# The reason they are conditional is that based on the output of a node, one of several paths may be taken.
# The path that is taken is not known until that node is run (the LLM decides).
# 
# 1. Conditional Edge: after the agent is called, we should either:
#    a. If the agent said to take an action, then the function to invoke tools should be called
#    b. If the agent said that it was finished, then it should finish
# 2. Normal Edge: after the tools are invoked, it should always go back to the agent to decide what to do next
# 
# Let's define the nodes, as well as a function to decide how what conditional edge to take.



from langchain_core.agents import AgentFinish

from langgraph.prebuilt.tool_executor import ToolExecutor

# This a helper class we have that is useful for running tools
# It takes in an agent action and calls that tool and returns the result
tool_executor = ToolExecutor(tools)


# **MODIFICATION**
# 
# Here, we modify the agent to only look at the last five intermediate steps. This is a relatively simple example of shortening the intermediate step history.



# Define the agent
def run_agent(data):
    inputs = data.copy()
    if len(inputs["intermediate_steps"]) > 5:
        inputs["intermediate_steps"] = inputs["intermediate_steps"][-5:]
    agent_outcome = agent_runnable.invoke(inputs)
    return {"agent_outcome": agent_outcome}


# Define the function to execute tools
def execute_tools(data):
    # Get the most recent agent_outcome - this is the key added in the `agent` above
    agent_action = data["agent_outcome"]
    output = tool_executor.invoke(agent_action)
    return {"intermediate_steps": [(agent_action, str(output))]}


# Define logic that will be used to determine which conditional edge to go down
def should_continue(data):
    # If the agent outcome is an AgentFinish, then we return `exit` string
    # This will be used when setting up the graph to define the flow
    if isinstance(data["agent_outcome"], AgentFinish):
        return "end"
    # Otherwise, an AgentAction is returned
    # Here we return `continue` string
    # This will be used when setting up the graph to define the flow
    else:
        return "continue"


# ## Define the graph
# 
# We can now put it all together and define the graph!



from langgraph.graph import END, StateGraph, START

# Define a new graph
workflow = StateGraph(AgentState)

# Define the two nodes we will cycle between
workflow.add_node("agent", run_agent)
workflow.add_node("action", execute_tools)

# Set the entrypoint as `agent`
# This means that this node is the first one called
workflow.add_edge(START, "agent")

# We now add a conditional edge
workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    # First, we define the start node. We use `agent`.
    # This means these are the edges taken after the `agent` node is called.
    "agent",
    # Next, we pass in the function that will determine which node is called next.
    should_continue,
    # Finally we pass in a mapping.
    # The keys are strings, and the values are other nodes.
    # END is a special node marking that the graph should finish.
    # What will happen is we will call `should_continue`, and then the output of that
    # will be matched against the keys in this mapping.
    # Based on which one it matches, that node will then be called.
    {
        # If `tools`, then we call the tool node.
        "continue": "action",
        # Otherwise we finish.
        "end": END,
    },
)

# We now add a normal edge from `tools` to `agent`.
# This means that after `tools` is called, `agent` node is called next.
workflow.add_edge("action", "agent")

# Finally, we compile it!
# This compiles it into a LangChain Runnable,
# meaning you can use it as you would any other runnable
app = workflow.compile()




inputs = {"input": "what is the weather in sf", "chat_history": []}
for s in app.stream(inputs):
    print(list(s.values())[0])
    print("----")
