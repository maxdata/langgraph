# # How to kick off background runs
# 
# This guide covers how to kick off background runs for your agent.
# This can be useful for long running jobs.



# Initialize the client
from langgraph_sdk import get_client

client = get_client()




# List available assistants
assistants = await client.assistants.search()
assistants[0]




# NOTE: we can use `assistant_id` UUID from the above response, or just pass graph ID instead when creating runs. we'll use graph ID here
assistant_id = "agent"




# Create a new thread
thread = await client.threads.create()
thread




# If we list runs on this thread, we can see it is empty
runs = await client.runs.list(thread["thread_id"])
runs




# Let's kick off a run
input = {"messages": [{"role": "human", "content": "what's the weather in sf"}]}
run = await client.runs.create(thread["thread_id"], assistant_id, input=input)




# The first time we poll it, we can see `status=pending`
await client.runs.get(thread["thread_id"], run["run_id"])




# Wait until the run finishes
await client.runs.join(thread["thread_id"], run["run_id"])




# Eventually, it should finish and we should see `status=success`
await client.runs.get(thread["thread_id"], run["run_id"])




# We can get the final results
final_result = await client.threads.get_state(thread["thread_id"])




final_result




# We can get the content of the final message
final_result["values"]["messages"][-1]["content"]
