# # Human-in-the-loop
# 
# In this example we will build a ReAct Agent that has a human in the loop. We will use the human to approve specific actions.
# 
# This examples builds off the base chat executor. It is highly recommended you learn about that executor before going through this notebook. You can find documentation for that example [here](./base.ipynb).
# 
# Any modifications of that example are called below with **MODIFICATION**, so if you are looking for the differences you can just search for that.

# ## Setup
# 
# First we need to install the packages required



get_ipython().run_cell_magic('capture', '--no-stderr', '%pip install --quiet -U langgraph langchain_community langchain_openai tavily-python\n')


# Next, we need to set API keys for OpenAI (the LLM we will use) and Tavily (the search tool we will use)



import getpass
import os

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("OpenAI API Key:")
os.environ["TAVILY_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("Tavily API Key:")


# Optionally, we can set API key for [LangSmith tracing](https://smith.langchain.com/), which will give us best-in-class observability.



os.environ["LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2"] = "true"
os.environ["LANGCHAIN_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("LangSmith API Key:")


# ## Set up the tools
# 
# We will first define the tools we want to use.
# For this simple example, we will use a built-in search tool via Tavily.
# However, it is really easy to create your own tools - see documentation [here](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/how_to/custom_tools) on how to do that.
# 



from langchain_community.tools.tavily_search import TavilySearchResults

tools = [TavilySearchResults(max_results=1)]


# We can now wrap these tools in a simple ToolExecutor.
# This is a real simple class that takes in a ToolInvocation and calls that tool, returning the output.
# A ToolInvocation is any class with `tool` and `tool_input` attribute.
# 



from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolExecutor

tool_executor = ToolExecutor(tools)


# ## Set up the model
# 
# Now we need to load the chat model we want to use.
# Importantly, this should satisfy two criteria:
# 
# 1. It should work with messages. We will represent all agent state in the form of messages, so it needs to be able to work well with them.
# 2. It should work with OpenAI function calling. This means it should either be an OpenAI model or a model that exposes a similar interface.
# 
# Note: these model requirements are not requirements for using LangGraph - they are just requirements for this one example.
# 



from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# We will set streaming=True so that we can stream tokens
# See the streaming section for more information on this.
model = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, streaming=True)


# 
# After we've done this, we should make sure the model knows that it has these tools available to call.
# We can do this by converting the LangChain tools into the format for OpenAI function calling, and then bind them to the model class.
# 



model = model.bind_tools(tools)


# ## Define the agent state
# 
# The main type of graph in `langgraph` is the [StateGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/graphs/#langgraph.graph.StateGraph).
# This graph is parameterized by a state object that it passes around to each node.
# Each node then returns operations to update that state.
# These operations can either SET specific attributes on the state (e.g. overwrite the existing values) or ADD to the existing attribute.
# Whether to set or add is denoted by annotating the state object you construct the graph with.
# 
# For this example, the state we will track will just be a list of messages.
# We want each node to just add messages to that list.
# Therefore, we will use a `TypedDict` with one key (`messages`) and annotate it so that the `messages` attribute is always added to.
# 



import operator
from typing import Annotated, Sequence, TypedDict

from langchain_core.messages import BaseMessage


class AgentState(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[Sequence[BaseMessage], operator.add]


# ## Define the nodes
# 
# We now need to define a few different nodes in our graph.
# In `langgraph`, a node can be either a function or a [runnable](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/concepts/#langchain-expression-language-lcel).
# There are two main nodes we need for this:
# 
# 1. The agent: responsible for deciding what (if any) actions to take.
# 2. A function to invoke tools: if the agent decides to take an action, this node will then execute that action.
# 
# We will also need to define some edges.
# Some of these edges may be conditional.
# The reason they are conditional is that based on the output of a node, one of several paths may be taken.
# The path that is taken is not known until that node is run (the LLM decides).
# 
# 1. Conditional Edge: after the agent is called, we should either:
#    a. If the agent said to take an action, then the function to invoke tools should be called
#    b. If the agent said that it was finished, then it should finish
# 2. Normal Edge: after the tools are invoked, it should always go back to the agent to decide what to do next
# 
# Let's define the nodes, as well as a function to decide how what conditional edge to take.
# 



from langchain_core.messages import ToolMessage

# Define the function that determines whether to continue or not
def should_continue(state):
    messages = state["messages"]
    last_message = messages[-1]
    # If there is no function call, then we finish
    if not last_message.tool_calls:
        return "end"
    # Otherwise if there is, we continue
    else:

    # We construct an ToolInvocation for each tool call
    tool_invocations = []
    for tool_call in last_message.tool_calls:

            tool=tool_call["name"],
            tool_input=tool_call["args"],
        )
        tool_invocations.append(action)

    action = ToolInvocation(
        tool=tool_call["name"],
        tool_input=tool_call["args"],
    )
    # We call the tool_executor and get back a response
    responses = tool_executor.batch(tool_invocations, return_exceptions=True)
    # We use the response to create tool messages
    tool_messages = [
        ToolMessage(
            content=str(response),
            name=tc["name"],
            tool_call_id=tc["id"],

    return {"messages": tool_messages}


# ## Define the graph
# 
# We can now put it all together and define the graph!
# 
# **MODIFICATION**
# 
# We modify the graph to **interrupt** before calling the tools. This lets the user give approval to continue. Note that this is a simple example and we could modify it to change the tool input, use some other channel besides input, etc.
