# # (Deprecated) Chat Executor: with function calling
# 
# The function calling executor is deprecated in favor of [create_react_agent](../chat_agent_executor_with_function_calling/high-level-tools.ipynb).
# This was done to better align with the underlying model providers' migration from "function calling" to "tool calling", which typically supports parallel tool usage.
