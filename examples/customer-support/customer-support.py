# # Build a Customer Support Bot
# 
# Customer support bots can free up teams' time by handling routine issues, but it can be hard to build a bot that reliably handles diverse tasks in a way that doesn't leave the user pulling their hair out.
# 
# In this tutorial, you will build a customer support bot for an airline to help users research and make travel arrangements. You'll learn to use LangGraph's interrupts and checkpointers and more complex state to organize your assistant's tools and manage a user's flight bookings, hotel reservations, car rentals, and excursions. It assumes you are familiar with the concepts presented in the [LangGraph introductory tutorial](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/introduction/).
# 
# By the end, you'll have built a working bot and gained an understanding of  LangGraph's key concepts and architectures. You'll be able to apply these design patterns to your other AI projects.
# 
# Your final chat bot will look something like the following diagram:
# 
# ![Final Diagram](./img/part-4-diagram.png)
# 
# Let's start!
# 
# ## Prerequisites
# 
# First, set up your environment. We'll install this tutorial's prerequisites, download the test DB, and define the tools we will reuse in each section.
# 
# We'll be using Claude as our LLM and define a number of custom tools. While most of our tools will connect to a local sqlite database (and require no additional dependencies), we will also provide a general web search to the agent using Tavily.

# 
# #### Lookup Company Policies
# 
# The assistant retrieve policy information to answer user questions. Note that _enforcement_ of these policies still must be done within the tools/APIs themselves, since the LLM can always ignore this.

# ## Part 1: Zero-shot Agent
# 
# When building, it's best to start with the simplest working implementation and use an [evaluation tool like LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/evaluation) to measure its efficacy. All else equal, prefer simple, scalable solutions to complicated ones. In this case, the single-graph approach has limitations. The bot may take undesired actions without user confirmation, struggle with complex queries, and lack focus in its responses. We'll address these issues later. 
# 
# In this section, we will define a simple Zero-shot agent as the assistant, give the agent **all** of our tools, and prompt it to use them judiciously to assist the user.
# 
# The simple 2-node graph will look like the following:
# 
# ![Part 1 Diagram](./img/part-1-diagram.png)
# 
# Start by defining the state.
# 
# #### State
# 
# Define our `StateGraph`'s state as a typed dictionary containing an append-only list of messages. These messages form the chat history, which is all the state our simple assistant needs.

from typing_extensions import TypedDict

from langgraph.graph.message import AnyMessage, add_messages


class State(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list[AnyMessage], add_messages]


# #### Agent
# 
# Next, define the assistant function. This function takes the graph state, formats it into a prompt, and then calls an LLM for it to predict the best response.

# #### Part 1 Review
# 
# Our simple assistant is not bad! It was able to respond reasonably well for all the questions, quickly respond in-context, and successfully execute all our tasks. You can (check out an example LangSmith trace)[https://smith.langchain.com/public/f9e77b80-80ec-4837-98a8-254415cb49a1/r/26146720-d3f9-44b6-9bb9-9158cde61f9d] to get a better sense of how the LLM is prompted throughout the interactions above.
# 
# If this were a simple Q&A bot, we'd probably be happy with the results above. Since our customer support bot is taking actions on behalf of the user, some of its behavior above is a bit concerning:
# 
# 1. The assistant booked a car when we were focusing on lodging, then had to cancel and rebook later on: oops! The user should have final say before booking to avoid unwanted feeds.
# 2. The assistant struggled to search for recommendations. We could improve this by adding more verbose instructions and examples using the tool, but doing this for every tool can lead to a large prompt and overwhelmed agent.
# 3. The assistant had to do an explicit search just to get the user's relevant information. We can save a lot of time by fetching the user's relevant travel details immediately so the assistant can directly respond.
# 
# In the next section, we will address the first two of these issues.

# ## Part 2: Add Confirmation
# 
# When an assistant takes actions on behalf of the user, the user should (almost) always have the final say on whether to follow through with the actions. Otherwise, any small mistake the assistant makes (or any prompt injection it succombs to) can cause real damage to the user.
# 
# In this section, we will use `interrupt_before` to pause the graph and return control to the user **before** executing any of the tools.
# 
# Your graph will look something like the following:
# 
# ![Part 2 diagram](./img/part-2-diagram.png)
# 
# As before, start by defining the state:
# 
# #### State & Assistant
# 
# Our graph state and LLM calling is nearly identical to Part 1 except Exception:
# 
# - We've added a `user_info` field that will be eagerly populated by our graph
# - We can use the state directly in the `Assistant` object rather than using the configurable params

# #### Part 2 Review
# 
# Now our assistant was able to save a step to respond with our flight details. We also completely controlled which actions were performed. This all worked using LangGraph's `interrupts` and `checkpointers`. The interrupt pauses graph execution, its state safely persisted using your configured checkpointer. The user can then start it up at any time by running it with the right config.
# 
# See an [example LangSmith trace](https://smith.langchain.com/public/b3c71814-c366-476d-be6a-f6f3056caaec/r) to get a better sense of how the graph is running. Note [from this trace](https://smith.langchain.com/public/a077f4be-6baa-4e97-89f7-0dabc65c0fd0/r) that you typically **resume** a flow by invoking the graph with `(None, config)`. The state is loaded from the checkpoint as if it never was interrupted.
# 
# This graph worked pretty well! We *didn't really* need to be involved in *EVERY* assistant action, though...
# 
# In the next section, we will reorganize our graph so that we can interrupt only on the "sensitive" actions that actually write to the database.

# ## Part 3: Conditional Interrupt
# 
# In this section, we'll refine our interrupt strategy by categorizing tools as safe (read-only) or sensitive (data-modifying). We'll apply interrupts to the sensitive tools only, allowing the bot to handle simple queries autonomously.
#

# #### Part 3 Review
# 
# Much better! Our agent is now working well - [check out a LangSmith trace](https://smith.langchain.com/public/a0d64d8b-1714-4cfe-a239-e170ca45e81a/r) of our latest run to inspect its work! You may be satisfied with this design. The code is contained, and it's behaving as desired. 
# 
# One problem with this design is that we're putting a lot of pressure on a single prompt. If we want to add more tools, or if each tool gets more complicated (more filters, more business logic constraining behavior, etc), it's likely the tool usage and overall behavior of the bot will start to suffer. 
# 
# In the next section, we show how you can take more control over different user experiences by routing to specialist agents or sub-graphs based on the user's intent.

# ## Part 4: Specialized Workflows
# 
# In the previous sections, we saw how "wide" chat-bots, relying on a single prompt and LLM to handle various user intents, can get us far. However, it's difficult to create **predictably great** user experiences for known intents with this approach.
# 
# Alternatively, your graph can detect userintent and select the appropriate workflow or "skill" to satisfy the user's needs. Each workflow can focus on its domain, allowing for isolated improvements without degrading the overall assistant.
# 
# In this section, we'll split user experiences into separate sub-graphs, resulting in a structure like this:
# 
# ![Part 4 Diagram](./img/part-4-diagram.png)
# 
# In the diagram above, each square wraps an agentic, focused workflow. The primary assistant fields the user's initial queries, and the graph routes to the appropriate "expert" based on the query content.
# 
# #### State
# 
# We want to keep track of which sub-graph is in control at any given moment. While we _could_ do this through some arithmetic on the message list, it's easier to track as a dedicated **stack**. 
# 
# Add a `dialog_state` list to the `State` below. Any time a `node` is run and returns a value for `dialog_state`, the `update_dialog_stack` function will be called to determine how to apply the update.

# #### Assistants
# 
# This time we will create an assistant **for every workflow**. That means:
# 
# 1. Flight booking assistant
# 2. Hotel booking assistant
# 3. Car rental assistant
# 4. Excursion assistant
# 5. and finally, a "primary assistant" to route between these
# 
# If you're paying attention, you may recognize this as an example of the **supervisor** design pattern from our Multi-agent examples.
# 
# Below, define the `Runnable` objects to power each assistant.
# Each `Runnable` has a prompt, LLM, and schemas for the tools scoped to that assistant.
# Each *specialized* / delegated assistant additionally can call the `CompleteOrEscalate` tool to indicate that the control flow should be passed back to the primary assistant. This happens if it has successfully completed its work or if the user has changed their mind or needs assistance on something that beyond the scope of that particular workflow.

# #### Create Assistant
# 
# We're about ready to create the graph. In the previous section, we made the design decision to have a shared `messages` state between all the nodes. This is powerful in that each delegated assistant can see the entire user journey and have a shared context. This, however, means that weaker LLMs can easily get mixed up about there specific scope. To mark the "handoff" between the primary assistant and one of the delegated workflows (and complete the tool call from the router), we will add a `ToolMessage` to the state.
# 
# 
# #### Utility
# 
# Create a function to make an "entry" node for each workflow, stating "the current assistant ix `assistant_name`".



from typing import Callable

                    " and the booking, update, other other action is not complete until after you have successfully invoked the appropriate tool."
                    " If the user changes their mind or needs help for other tasks, call the CompleteOrEscalate function to let the primary host assistant take control."

        }

    return entry_node


# #### Define Graph
# 
# Now it's time to start building our graph. As before, we'll start with a node to pre-populate the state with the user's current information.

builder.add_edge(START, "fetch_user_info")


# Now we'll start adding our specialized workflows. Each mini-workflow looks very similar to our full graph in [Part 3](#part-3-conditional-interrupt), employing 5 nodes:
# 
# 1. `enter_*`: use the `create_entry_node` utility you defined above to add a ToolMessage signaling that the new specialized assistant is at the helm
# 2. Assistant: the prompt + llm combo that takes in the current state and either uses a tool, asks a question of the user, or ends the workflow (return to the primary assistant)
# 3. `*_safe_tools`: "read-only" tools the assistant can use without user confirmation.
# 4. `*_sensitive_tools`: tools with "write" access that require user confirmation (and will be assigned an `interrupt_before` when we compile the graph)
# 5. `leave_skill`: _pop_ the `dialog_state` to signal that the *primary assistant* is back in control
# 
# Because of their similarities, we _could_ define a factory function to generate these. Since this is a tutorial, we'll define them each explicitly.
# 
# First, make the **flight booking assistant** dedicated to managing the user journey for updating and canceling flights.

# #### Conclusion:
# 
# You've now developed a customer support bot that handles diverse tasks using focused workflows.
# More importantly, you've learned to use some of LangGraph's core features to design and refactor an application based on your product needs.
# 
# The above examples are by no means optimized for your unique needs - LLMs make mistakes, and each flow can be made more reliable through better prompts and experimentation. Once you've created your initial support bot, the next step would be to start [adding evaluations](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/evaluation) so you can confidently improve your system. Check out those docs and our other tutorials to learn more!
