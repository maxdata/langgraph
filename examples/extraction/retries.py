    LLMs that support tool calling can generate structured JSON. However, they may not always

# ## JSONPatch
# 
# The regular retry method worked well for our simple case, but it still was unable to self-correct when populating a complex schema.
# 
# LLMs work best on narrow tasks. A tried-and-true principle of LLM interface design is to simplify the task for each LLM run.
# 
# One way to do this is to **patch** the state instead of completely regenerating the state. One way to do this is with `JSONPatch` operations. Let's try it out!
# 
# Below, create a JSONPatch retry graph. This works as follows:
# 1. First pass: try to generate the full output.
# 2. Retries: prompt the LLM to generate **JSON patches** on top of the first output to heal the erroneous generation.
# 
# The fallback LLM just has to generate a list of paths, ops (add, remove, replace), and optional values. Since the pydantic validation errors include the path in their errors, the LLM should be more reliable.

# #### And it works!
# 
# Retries are an easy way to reduce function calling failures. While retrying may become unnecessary with more powerful LLMs, data validation is important to control how LLMs interact with the rest of your software stack.
# 
# If you notice high retry rates (using an observability tool like LangSmith), you can set up a rule to send the failure cases to a dataset alongside the corrected values and then automatically program those into your prompts or schemas (or use them as few-shots to have semantically relevant demonstrations).
