# # How to add breakpoints
# 
# Human-in-the-loop (HIL) interactions are crucial for [agentic systems](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/agentic_concepts/#human-in-the-loop). [Breakpoints](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/low_level/#breakpoints) are a common HIL interaction pattern, allowing the graph to stop at specific steps and seek human approval before proceeding (e.g., for sensitive actions). 
# 
# Breakpoints are built on top of LangGraph [checkpoints](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/low_level/#checkpointer), which save the graph's state after each node execution. Checkpoints are saved in [threads](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/low_level/#threads) that preserve graph state and can be accessed after a graph has finished execution. This allows for graph execution to pause at specific points, await human approval, and then resume execution from the last checkpoint.

# ## Setup
# 
# First we need to install the packages required



get_ipython().run_cell_magic('capture', '--no-stderr', '%pip install --quiet -U langgraph langchain_anthropic\n')


# Next, we need to set API keys for Anthropic (the LLM we will use)



import getpass
import os


def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")


_set_env("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")


# Optionally, we can set API key for [LangSmith tracing](https://smith.langchain.com/), which will give us best-in-class observability.



os.environ["LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2"] = "true"
_set_env("LANGCHAIN_API_KEY")


# ## Simple Usage
# 
# Let's look at very basic usage of this.
# 
# Below, we do two things:
# 
# 1) We specify the [breakpoint](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/low_level/#breakpoints) using `interrupt_before` the specified step.
# 
# 2) We set up a [checkpointer](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/low_level/#checkpointer) to save the state of the graph.

# ## Agent
# 
# In the context of agents, breakpoints are useful to manually approve certain agent actions.
#  
# To show this, we will build a relatively simple ReAct-style agent that does tool calling. 
# 
# We'll add a breakpoint before the `action` node is called.
