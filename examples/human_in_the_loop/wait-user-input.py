# # How to wait for user input
# 
# Human-in-the-loop (HIL) interactions are crucial for [agentic systems](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/agentic_concepts/#human-in-the-loop). Waiting for human input is a common HIL interaction pattern, allowing the agent to ask the user clarifying questions and await input before proceeding. 
# 
# We can implement this in LangGraph using a [breakpoint](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/human_in_the_loop/breakpoints/): breakpoints allow us to stop graph execution at a specific step. At this breakpoint, we can wait for human input. Once we have input from the user, we can add it to the graph state and proceed.

# ## Setup
# 
# First we need to install the packages required



get_ipython().run_cell_magic('capture', '--no-stderr', '%pip install --quiet -U langgraph langchain_anthropic langchain_openai\n')


# Next, we need to set API keys for Anthropic and / or OpenAI (the LLM(s) we will use)



import getpass
import os


def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")


_set_env("OPENAI_API_KEY")
_set_env("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")


# Optionally, we can set API key for [LangSmith tracing](https://smith.langchain.com/), which will give us best-in-class observability.



os.environ["LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2"] = "true"
_set_env("LANGCHAIN_API_KEY")


# ## Simple Usage
# 
# Let's look at very basic usage of this. One intuitive approach is simply to create a node, `human_feedback`, that will get user feedback. This allows us to place our feedback gathering at a specific, chosen point in our graph.
#  
# 1) We specify the [breakpoint](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/low_level/#breakpoints) using `interrupt_before` our `human_feedback` node.
# 
# 2) We set up a [checkpointer](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/low_level/#checkpointer) to save the state of the graph up until this node.
# 
# 3) We use `.update_state` to update the state of the graph with the human response we get.
# 
# * We [use the `as_node` parameter](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/low_level/#update-state) to apply this state update as the specified node, `human_feedback`.
# * The graph will then resume execution as if the `human_feedback` node just acted.

# ## Agent
# 
# In the context of agents, waiting for user feedback is useful to ask clarifying questions.
#  
# To show this, we will build a relatively simple ReAct-style agent that does tool calling. 
# 
# We will use OpenAI and / or Anthropic's models and a fake tool (just for demo purposes).



# Set up the state

# We are going "bind" all tools to the model

# Since `bind_tools` takes in tools but also just tool definitions,
# We can define a tool definition for `ask_human`
