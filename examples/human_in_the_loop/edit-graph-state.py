# # How to edit graph state
# 
# Human-in-the-loop (HIL) interactions are crucial for [agentic systems](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/agentic_concepts/#human-in-the-loop). Manually updating the graph state a common HIL interaction pattern, allowing the human to edit actions (e.g., what tool is being called or how it is being called).
# 
# We can implement this in LangGraph using a [breakpoint](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/human_in_the_loop/breakpoints/): breakpoints allow us to interrupt graph execution before a specific step. At this breakpoint, we can manually update the graph state and then resume from that spot to continue.

# ## Setup
# 
# First we need to install the packages required



get_ipython().run_cell_magic('capture', '--no-stderr', '%pip install --quiet -U langgraph langchain_anthropic\n')


# Next, we need to set API keys for Anthropic (the LLM we will use)



import getpass
import os


def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")


_set_env("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")


# Optionally, we can set API key for [LangSmith tracing](https://smith.langchain.com/), which will give us best-in-class observability.



os.environ["LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2"] = "true"
_set_env("LANGCHAIN_API_KEY")


# ## Simple Usage
# 
# Let's look at very basic usage of this.
# 
# Below, we do three things:
# 
# 1) We specify the [breakpoint](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/low_level/#breakpoints) using `interrupt_before` a specified step (node).
# 
# 2) We set up a [checkpointer](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/low_level/#checkpointer) to save the state of the graph up until this node.
# 
# 3) We use `.update_state` to update the state of the graph.

# ## Agent
# 
# In the context of agents, updating state is useful for things like editing tool calls.
#  
# To show this, we will build a relatively simple ReAct-style agent that does tool calling. 
# 
# We will use Anthropic's models and a fake tool (just for demo purposes).

# This means that this node is the first one called

# We now add a conditional edge

    # First, we define the start node. We use `agent`.

    # END is a special node marking that the graph should finish.
    # What will happen is we will call `should_continue`, and then the output of that
    # will be matched against the keys in this mapping.
    # Based on which one it matches, that node will then be called.

# Finally, we compile it!

# meaning you can use it as you would any other runnable

#

# It will get passed to the reducer function for the `messages` key
# That reducer function will use the ID of the message to update it
# It's important that it has the right ID! Otherwise it would get appended
# as a new message
